		<p>Four billion people in the world are still unconnected to the internet, and for many people coming online for the first time, it will be through a mobile device. While the actual devices, with their broad range of features, quality and manufacturers, have become affordable for the many, access to data remains to be the biggest barrier for new internet users. </p>

		<h3>Why Super Size Me, and why "Big Mac index"?</h3>

		<p>Since 1986, The Economist has been publishing what they call the “<a href="http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index">Big Mac index</a>”. By comparing at the average prices of the Big Mac in different countries’ McDonald locations, and using market exchange rates, the index shows in which countries the Big Mac is overvalued or undervalued. In a light-hearted way, it tests the purchasing-power parity theory, which says that eventually exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in any two countries. 

		<p>For our index above, we compare the prices of digitally consuming <i>Super Size Me</i>, a documentary about a man who only ate from McDonald's menu for an entire month. We put this together to test whether the consumption of digital economic goods holds up the same way as its physical counterpart. You can also think of consuming any other digital good or service, and differences in price from country to country. For instance, how much does using the mobile Facebook app cost for the average person in France versus those in South Korea?</p>

		<h3>How are consuming digital Big Macs different from the beef and buns kind?</h3>

		<p>For one, the real Big Mac has nearly 600 calories and a carbon footprint of 4 kg CO2-eq...</p> 

		<p>But for the sake of this index, we look at the economics behind it. As the graphic below shows, the value chain of a digital media product is much more complex. The content creator (whether it's the documentary maker, an app provider, brand, etc) has very little to do with the pricing. <br><br>

		In the end, for content that is free on the web, the consumer pays only for the data that they are streaming or downloading, which has nothing to do with the content that they are actually consuming. But even for the specific quantity and quality of data—an identical basket of goods and services—there are many providers that offer this at different prices even in a single neighborhood, city and country.</p>

		<h3>So what kind of economic good is the internet then? </h3>

		<p>Those who have been following the net neutrality debate would know that most rich countries have decided to regulate the internet as a public utility. For rest of the world, the UN in 2011 declared internet access a basic human right.
		<p>Despite the general consensus that the internet should be accessible and affordable for all, mobile broadband is twice as expensive in developing countries than in developed countries. When looking at the cost of internet as a percentage of GNI, this is even greater. In Niger, average monthly data cost is $66.08 (PPP), which accounts for 91% of their GNI per head. Icelanders spend $4.76 on average, which is 0.15% of their GNI per head.

		<h3>So why the huge discrepancy in price?</h3>

		<p>Mobile broadband is already the de facto option for accessing broadband internet services for most of the population in developing countries and the average monthly cost is decreasing globally. But overall the prices haven't stabilized much for the following reasons:
		<ol class="hanging_indent">
			<li>Inconsistent regulation: Neutrality of content and even quality of mobile connection are regulated in most countries (it’s a wholesale market). But retail regulation is applied in only some—35% of countries for retail mobile voice services in 2014, according to the International Telecommunications Unit, an agency of the United Nations.</li>
			<li>Stability of market: There is an absence of clear market leaders in most countries.</li>
			<li>Imperfect public utility pricing: In theory, public utility pricing works when regulators and utility have the same information. But utility oftentimes has more information about the underlying economic environment than regulators, and exploits it for their own benefit, especially those that are privately owned.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr />

		Assumptions and sources
		<ul class="hanging_indent">
			<li>All of the mobile broadband pricing data comes from the ITU. They are 2014 average prices, postpaid, handset-based, 500MB. More details on this can be found in the ITU's <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/publications/misr2015/MISR2015-w5.pdf">Measuring the Information Society Report</a></li>
			<li>We <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publications/">follow the UN’s</a> labeling of countries by “developing”, “least developed”, “developed”, and "economies in transition"</li>
			<li>GDP and GNI data come from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD">World Bank</a>. They are also 2014 data</li>
			<li>We chose to model mobile-broadband internet rather than fixed broadband as it stands at over 20% penetration in almost half of the countries of the developing world and is growing strongly. Fixed-broadband penetration lies below 2% in half of the developing countries, and below 1% in 85% of least developed countries. </li>
