		<p>Four billion people in the world are still unconnected to the internet, and for many people coming online for the first time, it will be through a mobile device. While the actual devices, with their broad range of features, quality and manufacturers, have become affordable for the many, access to data remains to be the biggest barrier for new internet users. </p>

		<h3>Why the Big Mac commercial?</h3>

		<p>Since 1986, The Economist has been publishing what they call the “Big Mac index”. By comparing at the average prices of the Big Mac in different countries’ McDonald locations, and using market exchange rates, the index shows in which countries the Big Mac is overvalued or undervalued. In a light-hearted way, it tests the purchasing-power parity theory, which says that eventually exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in any two countries. 

		For our index above, we compare the prices of digitally consuming a 60-s video clip of a Big Mac in countries around the world.</p>

		<h3>Where does this comparison fall apart?</h3>

		<p>As the graphic below shows, the value chain of a digital media product is much more complex. The content creator (which we could say is McDonalds since they either produced it in-house or paid an agency to do so) has very little to do with the pricing. <br><br>

		In the end, the consumer pays for the data that they are streaming, which has nothing to do with the content that they are actually consuming. But even for the specific quantity and quality of data—an identical basket of goods and services—there are many providers that offer this at different prices even in a single neighborhood, city and country.</p>

		<h3>So what kind of economic good is the internet then? </h3>

		<p>Those who have been following the net neutrality debate would know that most rich countries have decided to regulate the internet as a public utility. For rest of the world, the UN in 2011 declared internet access a basic human right.
		<p>Despite the general consensus that the internet should be accessible and affordable for all, mobile-broadband is twice as expensive in developing countries than in developed countries. Pricing for the same amount of data can ranges from XX to XX.

</div>
		<h3>So why the huge discrepancy in price?</h3>
		<ol class="hanging_indent">
			<li>Inconsistent regulation: Neutrality of content and even quality of mobile connection are regulated in most countries (it’s a wholesale market). But retail regulation is applied in only some—35% of countries for retail mobile voice services in 2014, according to the International Telecommunications Unit, an agency of the UN.</li>
			<li>Stability of market: There is an absence of clear market leaders in most countries.</li>
			<li>Imperfect public utility pricing: In theory, public utility pricing works when regulators and utility have the same information. But utility oftentimes has more information about the underlying economic environment than regulators, and exploits it for their own benefit, especially those than are privately owned.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr />

		Assumptions and sources
		<ul class="hanging_indent">
			<li>All of the mobile-broadband pricing data comes from the ITU. They are 2014 average prices, postpaid, handset-based, 500MB. More details on this can be found in the ITU's Measuring the Information Society Report</li>
			<li>We follow the UN’s grouping of countries by “developing”, “least developed”, and “developed”</li>
			<li>Smartphone penetration data comes from the Pew Research Center</li>
			<li>GDP and GNI data come from the World Bank. They are also 2014 data</li>
